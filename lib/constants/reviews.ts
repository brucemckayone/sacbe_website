      "I am starting my day with 20 chips of Cacao and after 2 days I am feeling that I am not 71 years old! My body feels very alert and ready to become the very fit person I use to be when I was a fitness instructor! Thanks to Sacbe cacao for giving me my life back! Xx",

      "I cannot believe the lack of bitterness in taste and the light texture of this cacao and it froths up so well. Really lovely to drink. But the feels!!!! Oh the feels!!! Sacbe Cacao gives me a jolt straight into my heart upon first sip, and I thought “oh maybe I’m not going to feel as much from this”, well I was wrong… SACBE feels to me like a slower experience (and don’t we all need a lesson in slowing down), it starts to wrap around my heart like a mist and it is so very heart opening. It is definitely more potent, I had really deep visualisations during meditation and I felt my third eye open and receptive. I also feel the effects of it for longer. The loving cacao energy lasted with me for around 5 hours yesterday (and I only had approx. 15g – I am beautifully sensitive!).",

      "Sacbe cacao is the first cacao brand I have drank and I have to say, it’s set a very high standard. Every time I drink Sacbe cacao, I really feel it in my heart. It’s a calm but strong beating which makes me feel more alive, allows me to feel into my heart fully so I can be fully present in each moment. I have shared it with my friends and they all love it too! I would recommend this to everyone, the yummy taste and the added health benefits are simply amazing. I’ve searched for a good hot chocolate all my life and I’ve know come to realise it was actually cacao I was needing – adding a tiny bit of honey, cinnamon and nutmeg brings out the flavour even more and gives it a little kick!",

      "The Sacbe cacao is amazing. This was my first experience drinking ceremonial cacao. I really like the packaging because it contains easy to follow instructions about how to make the cacao into a drink. The flavour was deep and chocolatey, with some earthy notes. The texture is smooth and full in the mouth, even though the drink is made only with water. It’s a real heart opener and the perfect preparation for meditation. I hadn’t understood the medicinal power of cacao before but I have already made my second order and look forward to taking part in a ceremony sometime. Thanks Luzura.",

      "This cacao is absolutely delicious and very nourishing! The energy behind the cacao production, it’s origins and the reverence for the medicine from the indigenous cultures that harvest the beans can be deeply felt. This cacao for me has a wonderful feminine energy; I feel this is also thanks to Luzura and her weaving of her inner magic by sourcing and sharing this amazing medicine here. This the best cacao I have had yet! Thank you!",
